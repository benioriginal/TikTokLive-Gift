run : pip install -r requirements.txt
run "script" put your id from "https://www.tiktok.com/@your_id/live" WITHOUT THE "@"
you can change the action that it does.U can ask me or search for pynput documentation 
also you can change the action based on how many gifts they sent by adding this:
elif event.gift.gift_type != number:
        print(f"{event.user.uniqueId} sent \"{event.gift.extended_gift.name}\"")
        (the action you want to do)

change the ,,number'' to how many gifts you want
Also _Bupi_ or Palarie_Mortala are noobs
enjoy!
